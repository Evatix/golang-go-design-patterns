## Golang Package Notes

1. Each folder is a package
2. Each folder cannot have multiple package
3. Where we are running from the go code, we must have a main package
4. We cannot have same name package twice
5. We cannot have multiple main packages
6. Each package can have multiple go file, and it doesn't have any other restriction
